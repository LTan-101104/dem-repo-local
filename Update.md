#I broke the repo by jumping from current commit to some commit in the past where the repo is "divergent"

#Not sure what exactly this means but it may seem that it is the time I have different branch

#Yet this error is a little bit weird, even in that case, I can merge it manually on the code editor

#So I don't know how to solve this, it is good to explore how problematic it could be when we jump back in branch though

#Can be useful later
